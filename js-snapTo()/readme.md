## Introduction

[Scroll snap points](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-scroll-snap-1/) are an important and powerful CSS feature. They enable the creation of pointer agnostic stepped scroll experiences, and do so very succinctly. The problem is, they're often used alongside adjacent elements which need to represent this stepped state of scroll, aka the user needs a way to see the state of the snap. Developers today write Javascript observers or create custom functions to monitor and drive this state. 

### Goals

To empower the scroll snapping container with an API for iterating through snap children in a reasonable way, for all snapping containers, including [2-dimensional matrix layouts](https://codepen.io/argyleink/pen/MWWpOmz) and support for all document directions and writing modes.

### Use Cases

Wiring up "snap to next", "snap to last" or "snap to the clicked item" should be trivial methods to call on a snap container:

1. Carousels
2. Sliders
3. Tabousels or Carotabs
4. Media galleries
5. Slides
6. Click/tap and snap to item

## Proposed Solution

### snapTo(`<axis>`, `<string>` or `<node>`)
- `<axis>` accepts
    - strings (x | y | inline | block | both)
- `<string | node>` accepts
    - strings (next | prev | first | last)
    - node
        - must be a child of the scroller and a registered snap child of the snapport

Example usage:  
```js
scrollSnapContainer.snapTo('x', 'next')
scrollSnapContainer.snapTo('y', 'prev')
scrollSnapContainer.snapTo('inline', 'first')
scrollSnapContainer.snapTo('block', 'last')
scrollSnapContainer.snapTo('x', scrollSnapContainer.querySelector('.child-2'))
```

<br>

### Edge Cases
#### `"next"` is requested when at the end
If current snapped element is `node.lastElementChild`, then no snapping occurs. The "next" element is the current element, yielding no change in snap position.

#### `"prev"` is requested when at the end
If current snapped element is `node.firstElementChild`, then no snapping occurs. The "prev" element is the current element, yielding no change in snap position.

## Examples
### Example 1 `.snapTo('x', 'next')`
The browser should scroll in that direction the same amount as if the `right arrow key` was pressed and perform it's routine regarding proximity and mandatory next snap target discovery.

### Example 2 `.snapTo('inline', 'next')`
If the browser is set to `rtl`, then the browser should scroll left the same amount as if the `left arrow key` was pressed and perform it's routine regarding proximity and mandatory next snap target discovery.
