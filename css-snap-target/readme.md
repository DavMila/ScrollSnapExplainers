## Introduction

User Agents privately maintain scroll snap state, leaving web developers unable to update their interfaces accordingly. 

A scroll snap container can have any nested child snapped to either the x or y axes (or inline/block respectively). Since its 2-dimensional, a UA is likely unable to report a single snapped element for a container which is what most authors will expect. By restricting the pseudo-class to an axis, the state request is more specific and easier to fulfill.

### Goals

Reduce Javascript responsibility and enable a declarative pattern for updating interface children if they are currently snapped.

### Use Cases

- Carousels
- ListViews (great for making selections in long lists)
- Galleries (almost always an active item with additional UI to show)

## Proposed Solution

```css
:snapped-inline-target {
  ...
}

section:snapped-block-target > header {
  ...
}
```

<br>

## Examples

#### 1: Lifted card snap child

```css
.card:snapped-inline-target {
  --shadow-distance: 30px; /* raised size */
}
```

### 2: Accessible outline on snap child

```css
:snapped-x-target {
  outline: 3px solid hotpink;
}
```

### 3: Lifted sticky section header navigation

```css
section:snapped-y-target > header {
  box-shadow: 0 .5em 1em .5em lch(5% 5% 200);
}
```
