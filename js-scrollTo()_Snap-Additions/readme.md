## Introduction

[Scroll snap points](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-scroll-snap-1/) are an important and powerful CSS feature. They enable the creation of pointer agnostic stepped scroll experiences, and do so very succinctly. The problem is, they're often used alongside adjacent elements which need to represent this stepped state of scroll, aka the user needs a way to see the state of the snap. Developers today write Javascript observers or create custom functions to monitor and drive this state. 

Wiring up "snap to next", "snap to last" or "snap to the clicked item" should be trivial methods to call on a snap container.

### Goals

To empower the scroll snapping container with an API for iterating through snap children in a reasonable way, for all snapping containers, including [2-dimensional matrix layouts](https://codepen.io/argyleink/pen/MWWpOmz) and support for all document directions and writing modes. 

### Use Cases

1. Carousels
2. Sliders
3. Tabousels or Carotabs
4. Media galleries
5. Slides
6. Click/tap and snap to item

## Proposed Additions
New values for the [`scrollToOptions`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ScrollToOptions) dictionary of the [CSSOM View](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#dictdef-scrolltooptions). This would enable APIs like `Window.scrollTo()`, `Element.scrollBy()` and `Element.scrollIntoView()` to be aware and offer APIs to programmatic snapping.

**New values for scrolling containers:**
- `snap-next`
- `snap-prev`
- `snap-first`
- `snap-last`

**New values for scroll children:**
- `snap-self`

## Examples

#### 1: basic
```js
container.scrollTo({
  left: 'snap-next',
})
```

#### 2: Control animation
```js
container.scrollTo({
  left: 'snap-prev',
  behavior: 'smooth',
})
```

#### 3: 2D
```js
container.scrollTo({
  left: 'snap-first',
  top: 'snap-first',
  behavior: 'instant',
})
```

#### 4: To a specific element
```js
container.querySelector('.child-2').scrollIntoView({
  top: 'snap-self',
  behavior: 'smooth',
})
```
