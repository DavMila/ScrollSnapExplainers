## Introduction

User Agents privately maintain scroll snap state, leaving web developers unable to update complimentary interfaces accordingly. Scroll snapping is often used for "picker UX", [made popular by iOS](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*LJujvSAe2lGVdY2ETmg5ew.png).  

A scroll snap container can have any nested child snapped to either the x or y axes (or inline/block respectively). Since its 2-dimensional, a UA is likely unable to report a single snapped element for a container which is what most authors will expect. Adding axes to the pseudo-class makes the request more specific and able to fulfill 2D scenarios. It will be possible for multiple elements to match this selector. It will be possible for many elements to never match the `:snapped` selector.

The match timing should synchronize with the same frame the UA has decided on a new snap child. Sooner is better than later, but UA's can decide.

### Common Gotcha
Depending on the scroll snap styles, some (many) snap children may never become snapped. This is a recurring UX and API question, as a scroll gesture may be limited or at the end, and the desired snap target cannot be brought to the snap axis alignment area. 

Take the following example, where figure elements want to align to `start` but the container is scrolled to the end. Essentially, the last 2 figures will never be snapped:

Unless!  
Styles are added so the user can scroll to the last item, aka enough padding in the container so items at the end can align on the axis:

### Goals
Reduce Javascript responsibility and enable a declarative pattern for updating interface children if they are currently snapped.

### Use Cases
- Carousels
- ListViews (great for making selections in long lists)
- Galleries (almost always an active item with additional UI to show)

## Proposed Solution
5 new CSS pseudo-class selectors. 4 for higher specificity targetting, 1 for loose matching:

|   |   |
|:----------|:-------------| 
| Name: | `:snapped` or `:snapped-block` `:snapped-y` `:snapped-inline` `:snapped-x` |   

<br>

The loose example, estimated to be the most commonly used, will match all scroll snap targets, regardless of axis. Assuming folks aren't overlapping scroll snap children, this should be quite reliable.

```css
:snapped {
  outline: hotpink;
}
```

**Features:**  
- Allows loose targeting shorthand for authors with distinct axis snap targets
- Allows specific axis selecting in 2D cases

## Examples

#### 1: Lifted card snap child

```css
.card:snapped {
  --shadow-distance: 30px; /* raised size */
}
```

### 2: Accessible outline on snap child

```css
:snapped-x {
  outline: 3px solid hotpink;
}
```

### 3: Lifted sticky section header navigation

```css
section:snapped-y > header {
  box-shadow: 0 .5em 1em .5em lch(5% 5% 200);
  border-inline-start-color: hotpink;
}
```
