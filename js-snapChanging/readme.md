## Introduction

CSS scroll snap points are often used as a mechanism to create scroll interactive "selection" components, where selection is determined with javascript with intersection observers and a scroll end guestimate. By creating a built-in event, the invisible state will become actionable, at the right time, and always correct.

## Goals

Help developers sychronize a snapped scroll item with the rest of their interface elements efficiently and effectively.

<br>

## Use Cases

Scroll centric selection:
- Date / Time picker
- Carousel
- Tabs
- State / Country picker

<br>

## Proposed Solution

A new javascript event for scroll snap container elements called `snapchanging`

- Should only fire if user interaction has ended, and a new item has been truly rested on. If a user is still touching the screen or the touchpad, this event should not fire, even if the scroll position is exactly at a snapped elements position. 

<br>

**Type**: snapchanging (heavily inspired by [`snapped` comment](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/156#issuecomment-695085852))  
**Interface**: SnapEvent  
**Sync / Async**: Async  
**Bubbles**: Yes  
**Trusted Targets**: Element  
**Cancelable**: No  
**Composed**: Yes  
**Default action**: None  
**Context (trusted events):** 

<br>

- `Event.target`: scroll container the event target is in
- `SnapEvent.snappedList`: an object with 2 keys for each axis, each key returns an array of snapped targets
- `SnapEvent.snappedTargetsList`: an object with 2 keys for each axis, each key returns an array of the aggregated snap children
- `SnapEvent.invokedProgrammatically`: a boolean informing developers if a user or script invoked scroll that caused `snapchanged`
- `SnapEvent.smoothlyScrolled`: a boolean informing developers if the snap change was instant or interpolated

<br>

```
interface SnapEvent {
  readonly attribute EventTarget scrollContainer;

  readonly attribute SnapEvent Object snappedList{inline: Element, block: Element};
  readonly attribute SnapEvent Object snappedTargetsList{inline:[], block:[]};
  readonly attribute SnapEvent Bool invokedProgrammatically;
  readonly attribute SnapEvent Bool smoothlyScrolled;
};
```

<br>

## Examples

#### 1: Carousel is about to change selection

```js
carouselSnapContainer.addEventListener('snapchanging', event => {
  console.info(event.invokedProgrammatically)
})
```

#### 2: Tabs have begun snapping to a new element

```js
tabsSnapContainer.onsnapchanging = event = > {
  let inlineSnapTarget = event.snappedList.inline
  console.info(inlineSnapTarget)
}
```
