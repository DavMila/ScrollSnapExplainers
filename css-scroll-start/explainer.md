## Introduction

Scroll experiences don't always start at the beginning! Interactions with carousels, swipe controls, and listviews often start somewhere in the middle, and each require Javascript to set this position on page load. By enabling CSS to specify this scroll start x or y position, both users, page authors and browsers benefit:
- Colocate initial scroll position with other scroll styles
- JavaScript can be removed
- Post page load scroll shift mitigated

## Goals

* todo

## Use Cases
- Carousels
- Pull to refresh
- ListViews
- Galleries
- Swipe interactions (left to archive, right to delete)

## Proposed Solution

Spec should:
- Allow setting an absolute scroll value on either axis
- Allow setting both axes start positions at the same time
- Allow setting an element as the target

### Example 1: todo
#### Set the start position to a snap child
```css
.snap-scroll-x {
  overflow: scroll;
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
  scroll-snap-start-x: selector(.snap-scroll-x .child-2);
}
```

#### Set the start position to an absolute value
```css
:root { --nav-height: 100px }

.snap-scroll-y {
  scroll-snap-start-y: var(--nav-height);
}
```

#### Set both with a shorthand
x then y
```css
.snap-scroll {
  scroll-snap-start: 200px 400px;
}
```
