## Introduction

todo

## Goals

* todo

## Use Cases

- Scroll centric selection interfaces, like a dial or carousel
- Should only fire if user interaction has ended, and a new item has been truly rested on. If a user is still touching the screen or the touchpad, this event should not fire, even if the scroll position is exactly at a snapped elements position. 

## Proposed Solution

todo

### Example 1: todo

todo

```js
scrollingSnapContainer.addEventListener('snapchanged', event => {
  console.info(event)
  // todo
})
```
